# Getting Started Guides

## Learn Sensu in 15 minutes or less

Coming soon...

## The complete getting started guide

The purpose of this guide is to help new Sensu users to obtain a basic
understanding of the primitives or components used to build a comprehensive
monitoring solution. In the course of working through this guide, users should
be able to start monitoring servers, services, and application health, collect
and analyze metrics, and setup alerts.

## Objectives

This guide will provide an introduction to the following building blocks:

- [Intro to Checks][1] - used to monitor services or measure resources
- [Intro to Handlers][2] - for taking action on Sensu events, which are produced by checks
- [Intro to Filters][3] - for filtering (removing) events destined for one or more event handlers
- [Intro to Mutators][4] - transform event data for handlers
