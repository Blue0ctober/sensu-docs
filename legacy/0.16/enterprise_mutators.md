# Enterprise mutators

Sensu Core ships with a set of built-in [mutators](mutators) for
transforming event data into JSON, Ruby Hash, or extracting check
output. Sensu Enterprise comes with additional mutators, enabling
third-party integrations, and providing event handler authors with a
set of supported tools with well defined specifications.

## output_format {#output-format}

Sensu Enterprise simplifies the process of gaining insightful metrics
from complex distributed systems. The `output_format` enterprise
mutator makes it possible to mutate collected metrics in various
formats from disparate data sources, into a [proprietary intermediate
format](#sensu-metric-format) that has been optimized for portability.

The `output_format` enterprise mutator extracts metrics from check
result output. Users can specify an output format per check, enabling
the use of various check plugins (Nagios plugins, etc.) and data
sources. The `output_format` mutator currently supports several
mainstream specifications: [Nagios PerfData][nagios_perfdata],
[Graphite Plaintext][graphite_plaintext], [OpenTSDB][opentsdb], and
[Metrics 2.0 as a wire format][metrics20_wire]. An output format must
be specified in metric check definitions in order to use enterprise
third-party integrations for metrics. You may also leverage the
`output_format` mutator when writing your own Sensu event handlers.

The valid values for `output_format` are:

- `nagios_perfdata`
- `graphite_plaintext`
- `opentsdb`
- `metrics20_wire`

The following is an example of how to configure an output format for a
metric check, one that is making use of a Nagios plugin.

~~~ json
{
    "checks": {
        "ntp": {
            "command": "/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_ntp -H time.nrc.ca",
            "subscribers": [
                "all"
            ],
            "interval": 20,
            "output_format": "nagios_perfdata",
            "handlers": [
                "default",
                "graphite"
            ]
        }
    }
}

The following is an example of how to configure a regular Sensu event
handler to use the `output_format` enterprise mutator.

~~~ json
{
  "handlers": {
      "metrics": {
          "type": "pipe",
          "command": "custom-handler.rb",
          "mutator": "output_format"
      }
  }
}

### The Sensu Metric Format {#sensu-metric-format}

`tags|source name value timestamp\n`

- Tags are optional

- Tags are space delimeted key/value pairs, joined by `=`, eg. `dc=iad env=prod`

- Source must be a string, identifying where the measurement was taken

- Name must be an alphanumeric string, but may also contain `.-_`

- Value must be numeric

- Timestamp must be in epoch time, eg. `1403558187`

- Data points are newline delimited, eg. `\n`

The following is an example of two data points. The second data point does not have tags.

~~~
dc=iad env=prod|i-424242 the.answer 42 1403558187
|i-424242 mice.count 2 1403558187
