# API {#api}

The Sensu API provides access to the data that Sensu servers collect,
such as client information & current events. The API can also resolve
events and request check executions.

When using the Sensu [packages](packages), you can start the API on one or more
machines using the init script, eg. `/etc/init.d/sensu-api start`.

The API log can be found at `/var/log/sensu/sensu-api.log`.

## Configuration {#configuration}

The Sensu API requires some configuration, that can be in included in
`/etc/sensu/config.json`, or in its own configuration snippet, eg.
`/etc/sensu/conf.d/api.json`.

You must specify a port, all other configuration is optional. If you
wish to configure basic authentication, you must provide a user and a
password.
