# Install a Sensu dashboard

Sensu has several community maintained web dashboards.

Currently, it's recommended that you use [Uchiwa](dashboards_uchiwa),
as it works with the latest API changes.

See the [Uchiwa dashboard documentation](dashboards_uchiwa) for
installation and configuration instructions.
