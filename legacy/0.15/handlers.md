# Sensu handlers {#sensu-handlers}

## What are handlers? {#what-are-handlers}

Handlers are for taking action on [event data](events), such as sending an
email alert, creating a PagerDuty incident, or storing metrics in Graphite.

## Types {#handler-types}

There are several types of handlers.

### Pipe {#pipe-handler}

Pipe handlers are for executing a command (or script), passing it the
event data via `STDIN`. Here is an example that takes in event data, and
writes it to a file for inspection.

~~~ ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'rubygems'
require 'json'

# Read event data
event = JSON.parse(STDIN.read, :symbolize_names => true)
# Write the event data to a file
file_name = "/tmp/sensu_#{event[:client][:name]}_#{event[:check][:name]}"
File.open(file_name, 'w') do |file|
  file.write(JSON.pretty_generate(event))
end
~~~

#### Handler definition {#pipe-handler-definition}

~~~ json
{
  "handlers": {
    "file": {
      "type": "pipe",
      "command": "/etc/sensu/handlers/file.rb"
    }
  }
}
~~~

Here is an example that uses `mailx` to email the event data.

~~~ json
{
  "handlers": {
    "mail": {
      "type": "pipe",
      "command": "mailx -s 'sensu event' email@address.com"
    }
  }
}
~~~

*Warning*: These trivial handlers will not respect the popular `refresh` 
and `occurences` settings in the 
[check definition]([Checks](checks#common-custom-check-definitions).

If you need occurence filtering, advanced handler that takes advantage
of the `sensu-plugin` gem that can filter. See the available handlers
in the 
[sensu-community-plugins](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-community-plugins/tree/master/handlers)
repo for more non-trivial examples.

#### Handler configuration {#pipe-handler-configuration}

Handlers using the `sensu-plugin` Rubygem have access to Sensu configs
that can be used to configure specific settings for the handlers.  The
settings access is generalized and flexible, although there is a
standard convention for configuring handlers that has developed
organically.

Here is a hypothetical JSON snippet that is defining and configuring two
custom handlers.  The handler `my_handler1` pulls configuration settings
from within the handler definition (probably with
`settings['handlers']['my_handler1']['custom_setting']`). The
handler `my_handler2` gets its configuration settings from a
top-level namespace (probably with
`settings['my_handler2']['another_custom_setting']`).

Both of these configuration methods work fine.  Configuring within the
handler definition in the `handlers` keeps things organized,
although the typical convention is to use a top-level namespace for each
handler.  Check in the handler itself to see how it is accessing
configuration values.

~~~ json
{
  "handlers": {
    "my_handler1": {
      "type": "pipe",
      "command": "/etc/sensu/handlers/file.rb",
      "custom_setting": "custom_val"
    },
    "my_handler2": {
      "type": "pipe",
      "command": "/etc/sensu/handlers/file.rb"
    }
  },
  "my_handler2": {
     "conventional_configuration": "true",
     "another_custom_setting": "some_custom_value"
   }
}
~~~

### TCP {#tcp-handler}

TCP handlers are for writing event data to a TCP socket.

Here is an example that writes event data to a local TCP socket, port `4242`.

~~~ json
{
  "handlers": {
    "tcp_socket": {
      "type": "tcp",
      "socket": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 4242
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

### UDP {#udp-handler}

UDP handlers are for writing event data to a UDP socket.

Here is an example that writes event data to a local UDP socket, port `2424`.

~~~ json
{
  "handlers": {
    "udp_socket": {
      "type": "udp",
      "socket": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 2424
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

### Transport {#transport-handler}

Transport handlers are for publishing event data to a Sensu transport,
such as RabbitMQ (default).

Here is an example that publishes event data on an AMQP topic exchange
"events", as Sensu is using the RabbitMQ transport.

~~~ json
{
  "handlers": {
    "amqp_exchange": {
      "type": "transport",
      "pipe": {
        "type": "topic",
        "name": "events",
        "options": {
          "durable": "true",
          "passive": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

When using the RabbitMQ transport, you can refer to the Ruby AMQP
library documentation on [working with
exchanges](http://rubyamqp.info/articles/working_with_exchanges/) for
pipe options.

### Sets {#handler-sets}

Handler sets are for grouping handlers; a way to send the same event
data to one or more handlers, or simply create an alias.

~~~ json
{
  "handlers": {
    "default": {
      "type": "set",
      "handlers": [
        "file",
        "tcp_socket"
      ]
    }
  }
}
~~~

## Severity filtering {#severity-filtering}

Handlers have the option to only handle events of a particular severity.
For example, the PagerDuty handler should only be used when an event has
a `CRITICAL` check exit status `2` or is `OK` and resolving an event `0`.

*Note*: Sensu-server will always send events with the severity of OK to 
handlers, regardless of the severity filtering. If your handler must not
recieve OK events, it must filter in handler code.

~~~ json
{
  "handlers": {
    "pagerduty": {
      "type": "pipe",
      "command": "/etc/sensu/handlers/pagerduty.rb",
      "severities": [
        "critical",
        "ok"
      ]
    }
  }
}
~~~
